              Looking for a shift-based summer job to perform while researching, I began visiting local restaurants I enjoyed. Tupelo Honey is a southern restaurant with limited locations known for their weekend brunches. Located close to both campus and my house, I thought I would go in during off hours to determine if they were hiring. Due to an emergent back of house issue, I ended up waiting to talk to a manager for around an hour. This honestly didn’t bother me, as I had brought a book anyway. When I was finally able to talk to the regional manager, she said that because I seemed content to wait patiently and politely, she’d like to hire me as a server despite the fact that they weren’t actually hiring at the moment. During my time there I was promoted several times and had several repeat customers that asked for my section. Working as a waiter for gave me a unique opportunity to view the food service and hospitality industry from multiple perspectives; I recognize the necessity of detail-oriented scheduling, vendor negotiations, food safety issues and creating a unique and pleasurable dining experience for patrons.
